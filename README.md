Here you can find the project I did for my "Databases" and "Oracle DBMS" courses. 
I designed a small database, in order to simulate the way an accounting system works and then wrote several SQL queries and PL/SQL functions, procedures, packages 
and triggers in order to provide additional functionality.
FUrhtermore, I was required to create a simple app using Oracle Apex: https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/vlad_apex/sgbd-proiect/home
